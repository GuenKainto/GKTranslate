TextTranslate:
 - Use API to translate
 - You can add morelanguage if you want in code TextTranslateViewModel

VoiceTranslate
- Use System.Speech
i can't make a account for azure or Google cloud to use API :"(
you need to download language in your PC:
Go Setting -> Time and Language -> Language -> download the language that support speech to text or Text to speech you want
And try to setting this to your language in code VoiceTranslateViewModel
(because i lazy to add this and i can't download those language to test by some how )
- Use:
Click into "Start" button to starting speed to text, when you click "Stop" it will stop and say the output 
You can "Ctrl+Q" to start , but i don't know how and why it not load that when i start run
You can use this HotKey after you click "Start" in first time.

Some day i will fix it and add features where you can both play the game online and translate and play it in the game (Or maybe code with Python :D )
